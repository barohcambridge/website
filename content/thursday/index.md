# Thursday

## "-OHpen Mic"

![-OHpen Mic in session](images/ohpenmic.jpeg)

On Thursdays we run our regular open mic evening.  Get up on stage and
play your heart out, or just sit back and watch the fun while you
enjoy our [cocktails](../menu/index.md) and [assorted
games](../games/index.md).

## I want to watch!

Great!  The bigger the audience, the more fun for everyone.  Just
wander along on a Thursday evening, or [book yourself a
table](#booknow).

## I want to play!

We'd love to have you play in our open mic evening!  There's no formal
sign-up process: just arrive before 20:30 on a Thursday evening and
let us know what you'd like to perform.  All performers get one free
cocktail (or beer or glass of wine) and unlimited soft drinks.

We have a full drum kit and sound system, so there's no need to bring
your own amps or mics: just turn up with yourself and your instrument
and we'll sort out the rest.

You're welcome to book a table for yourself and your friends, to make
sure that you get a good spot right up close to the stage.  We look
forward to seeing you on Thursday!
