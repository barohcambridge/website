# Tuesday

## "Plug & Play"

![Plug & Play in session](images/plugandplay.jpeg)

On Tuesdays we host our jam sessions.  Staff and regulars get up on
stage and jam together for as long as the mood takes them.  Turn up,
plug in, and play along!

## I want to play my own set!

Tuesdays at Bar -OH are all about playing together.  But
we do also host a regular [open mic](../thursday/index.md) session on
Thursdays, which is the perfect place to try our your own solo act.

## I want to play with you!

Experienced musicians are very welcome to join in the jam session.
Arrive before 20:30 on a Tuesday evening and let us know that you'd
like to take part.  All performers get one free cocktail (or beer or
glass of wine) and unlimited soft drinks.

We have a full drum kit and sound system, so there's no need to bring
your own amps or mics: just turn up with yourself and your instrument
and we'll sort out the rest.

[Book in](#resdiary) and get yourself a great table where you can kick
back with a [tasty drink](../menu/index.md) and [play some
games](../games/index.md) in the gaps between the music!
