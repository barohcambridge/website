# Wednesday

## "Keys With Bryan"

![Bryan at the keyboard](images/keyswithbryan.jpeg)

On Wednesdays our resident bartender and pianist Bryan takes to the
stage for our keyboard lounge session, playing whatever takes his
fancy, from Sinatra to Flight of the Conchords.

Feel free to challenge Bryan with some requests of your own.  Bribes
are not required but may well be appreciated.  Do not ask him to play
"Baby Shark".

[Book yourself a table](#resdiary) and come listen to Bryan's creative
ambling on the keyboard while you enjoy a fabulous few
[cocktails](../menu/index.md) (possibly also made by Bryan).  Or just
let the music wash over you while you lose yourself playing on some of
our [retro consoles](../games/index.md).
