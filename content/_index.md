**Table service cocktails.  Board games.  Video games.  Occasional
sharks and robots.**

Welcome to Bar -OH.  We are a table service cocktail bar right in the
centre of Cambridge, where we have an unreasonable amount of fun
making [delicious drinks](menu) in unusual glasses and decorating
them with sharks.

We also have plenty of [retro consoles](games) and [board
games](games) that are completely free for you to play while you
enjoy your dramatically served cocktail.
