Welcome to Bar -OH.  We are a table service cocktail bar right in the
centre of Cambridge, where we have an unreasonable amount of fun
making [delicious drinks](menu.md) in unusual glasses and decorating
them with sharks.

We also have plenty of [retro consoles](games.md) and [board
games](games.md) that are completely free for you to play while you
enjoy your dramatically served cocktails.

We are open every night of the week for all your imbibing and gaming
needs.  Live music lovers may be lucky enough to be serenaded by our
in-house band or guest performers.
