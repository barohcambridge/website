We have a huge number of retro consoles: Wii, N64, GameCube, several
generations of Sony PlayStation, Xbox 360, a Pac-Man table, and many
more.  All of our consoles are free for you to play for as long as you
like.

We also have plenty of board games dotted around the venue that you're
welcome to grab and play while you drink.  As with the retro consoles,
all of our games are free for you to use so please help yourself!

Most of our tables have at least one retro console, and you're welcome
to request whichever one you like best (though we can't promise it'll
be available!).  If you'd like to wander around and try out all the
different consoles we have, just book yourself in for early in the
evening and you should be able to explore freely for hours!
