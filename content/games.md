## Consoles

We have a huge number of retro consoles: Wii, N64, GameCube, many
generations of Sony PlayStation, Xbox 360, and many more.  All of our
consoles are free for you to play for as long as you like!

Rock out with your friends on our Guitar Hero sofa.  We have guitars
and a DJ deck, and a couple of real guitar amps hooked up to the Xbox
360.

Take a few laps in our racing corner, with two steering wheel and
pedal sets ready for head-to-head action!

For a true arcade feel try out our gaming table, with old classics
such as Pac-Man and Space Invaders.

## Board games

We also have plenty of board games dotted around the venue that you're
welcome to grab and play while you drink.  As with the retro consoles,
all of our games are free for you to use so please help yourself!

## Booking

Most of our tables have at least one retro console, and you're welcome
to request whichever one you like best (though we can't promise it'll
be available!).  If you'd like to wander around and try out all the
different consoles we have, just book yourself in for early in the
evening and you should be able to explore freely for hours!
