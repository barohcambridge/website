We specialise in excitingly presented [cocktails](#house) made to our
own recipes: you can expect swirling smoke, edible [custom-printed
pictures](../photo/index.md), drinks served in a parrot or a bathtub,
and friendly sharks!

For the more classically minded cocktail connoisseur, we have a great
range of [spirits](#elements), and our bartenders will mix you pretty
much anything you can think of.  Are you in the mood for a refreshing
Italian 75, a smoky Mezcal Margarita, a Gibson Martini, a Sazerac, a
Manhattan, or a Pineapple Rum Old Fashioned?  Just say the word.

Not in the mood for a cocktail?  We have [wines](#wine) by the glass
and by the bottle, along with numerous local craft [beers](#beer).

For drivers and other non-drinkers, we've designed lots of our
own-recipe cocktails to work well without the alcohol.  Any cocktail
that you see on the menu marked with an asterisk (*) can be made as a
low-alcohol or no-alcohol version.
